## CVE-checker
----
Hey, look!

It's a piece of software which scrapes the internet for recently-updated CVEs, compares them to a list of software (or keywords) you give it, and checks if they have exploits.

You could set it to run every half an hour or so, and get alerted about a new, important vuln about three hours after you learn from twitter.

Have fun!

I have no idea what I am doing.
